    <p>Supermarket Bill Generation: In this project we can calculate and generate a billing receipt.<br> 
       The purpose of this project is to efficiently generate the purchasing bill digitally.<br>
       This project contains the basic functionality of python to learn the flow of the system.</p><br>
    <p>Caeser Cipher: Caesar Cipher in Python is an easy method to encrypt your message. Letter in a plain given text is changed to a
       letter that appears a certain number of positions farther down the alphabet. Decrypt key shows the number that how many timesletters were shifted during encryption.</p><br>
    <p>Digital Clock: I designed and implemented a digital clock project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing real-time
       hour, minute, and second updates with AM/PM indication. Leveraging JavaScript's Date object, the clock dynamically updates
       every second, offering users an accurate and visually pleasing time display</p><br>
